# Mem-s-Based-Hand-Gesture-Robot-Control
This project focuses on automating one of the most frequent industrial tasks ‚Äî picking and placing objects ‚Äî using a hand gesture-controlled robotic arm. The system utilizes accelerometer-based motion sensing to control the robotic arm wirelessly, reducing the need for manual labor and increasing precision in repetitive tasks.

## üß† Project Overview

Robotics is rapidly evolving to enhance flexibility, modularity, fault tolerance, and automation. This project introduces a robot arm controlled by human hand gestures, captured using accelerometer (MEMS) sensors. These sensors detect hand movement, which is processed and mimicked by a robotic system to perform pick and place tasks.

By eliminating manual effort and introducing IoT-based automation, this project serves industries where human labor is a constraint or where repetitive tasks require automation.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- Hand gesture-based control using MEMS accelerometer
- Wireless communication to the robotic arm via IoT (e.g., ESP8266)
- Automated pick and place functionality
- Modular and fault-tolerant robot design
- Low-cost and suitable for industrial or educational use

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

1. The user wears a glove or device containing a MEMS accelerometer.
2. As the user moves their hand, the sensor tracks X, Y, and Z-axis motion.
3. Arduino reads sensor data and maps gestures to specific robot arm actions.
4. Commands are sent to the robot arm, which picks and places objects accordingly.
5. The system can operate wirelessly using IoT or local RF communication.

## üí° Typical Use Case

| Gesture          | Robot Arm Action        |
|------------------|-------------------------|
| Tilt Forward     | Move arm forward        |
| Tilt Backward    | Move arm backward       |
| Tilt Left        | Rotate left             |
| Tilt Right       | Rotate right            |
| Hand Up          | Pick object             |
| Hand Down        | Place object            |
